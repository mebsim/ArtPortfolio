          Trashtown was a creation that me, Nizar and Alec had created. These people were also my partners in the Vessels for Change. Here we were tasked with creating an artwork using garbage only. We got a large board and started placing various items. As we searched for more items, we started imagining what they resembled like if they were a part of a little farm. The car was a nice catch and we used it. At the end we painted it all. The road used a color gradient (value) which adds a nice touch.
