         Hi there. I've followed my last year and have continued with art this year. Although a programmer at heart, I can and try to draw and sketch. Always loved adding a graphical side to all my work. As always,
         I am very heavily focused on using pencil and pen rather than colors, although I have tried to increase the use of colors this year. This year, we were taken through a series of different and unique mediums
         in which every one was different. From photography to sculptures, the work varied. For a while now, I've listed M.C. Escher as my favourite artist. His style of art and the level of detail in it has influenced 
         my own work.

         I tried to keep a consistent method of figuring out and planning my work. That typically starts with a few scribbles. These just clear my mind and sort of show me what twist I want to incorporate into this 
         work. I then often write down what the topic of the project is, then from there list out possible avenues that I could explore. I try to fill them out briefly, then move on to the decision phase. Here I 
         just mentally consider what I want to do, and what I can do. I'll make sketches of the possibilities and try various versions of it (unless I have my heart set on another one). From there I sort of go into 
         an observation mode. Here, all I do is either research, observe or imagine in more detail the drawing. I draw quick sketches of varying sizes and details to see issues. I'll quickly mark what I think is 
         wrong and try again. Through out this, I try to get other people's opinions and figure out what direction they think I should go. Although I try to get their opinions, I sometimes will not use their opinion 
         if I feel like it takes away from my message. To get a better picture of this, each of the entries on my home page for my 16-17 year is focused on one stage of the creative process.
