          I think that I'd be well suited to a job in the web designer field. This job entails, as the job name suggests, that I would be creating and most importantly designing websites for a variety of parties. This would require talking to the client and getting what they want out of the website and designing it so that it backs any messages or 
          ideas that are either associated or are advocated by the client. A web designer has the job of developing and creating the website. After the website has been created, they are made to maintain and add to the website. They work in teams of people in order to meet the requirements set by the client. Due to my current skill and experience 
          with creating websites, I already have the ability to go into the work. I've created websites for me as well as various people. I have experience with talking to them and sorting out what they need or want from their website. I also am good at linking and deciding on colors that both provoke an idea and work well together. That, as well 
          as my love for fonts, would help make it so that I could design that were both appealing and worked well. Although this might lean me towards a job as a typographer, I feel that other aspects of creating websites interest me more. I also have a strong interest in detail and would work hard to create something that had a bit of an obsessive 
          detail to making it as good as I can. This would involve large amount of testing and editing, talking with the client and various other things to ensure a good final product. I also have a strong interest in controlling the flow and how the eye moves in pieces. This is important in a website designer due to them having to figure out and plan 
          for how the user would look at the website and how they would perceive and receive the information.

			Artist Reflection

		  A favorite artist of mine is M.C. Escher. He was a Dutch artist who created various forms of art, such as graphic art and Lino block pictures Among the various artworks that he has done, a favorite of mine has always been the Hand with Reflecting Sphere. A Lithograph created in 1935, it captured various things that I always try to do in my 
		  own work. The level of detail in the piece is amazing. Everything from the books to the shading on the chairs in the background. Another thing was just the idea of drawing a reflection on the sphere. I've done this various times with some perspective drawings. It is something that takes more detail and time to do then many would expect. The 
		  replication of it in a drawing is something that I first saw with M.C. Escher in the Three Spheres. Another favorite, especially with the reflections on the ground and the different styles of spheres (one transparent-ish, another reflective, the last solid). This drawing shows M.C. Escher in a chair in his studio staring into it. This 
		  something that M.C. Escher did as his self-portraits. He'd have himself in a reflection. It's a bit of a common thing for him. He is well-known for his drawing which are often optical illusions of themselves. There is little evidence of there being a message behind the image. I think the work really got me because it was something that had 
		  little meaning and reason behind it, but rather focused more on the intricateness of the world around him. It also helps that his style of art has been, for the most part, not something I've ever seen. They were often new and something I've never seen. They do remind me of optical illusions and sometimes "Where's Waldo" because the level 
		  of detail in them.
