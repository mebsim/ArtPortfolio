          During the year, we were tasked with taking and editing images that we took. We explored and experimented with various angles, aperture settings and focuses. After spending weeks on the photos, I eventually got it down to the photos I liked the most. From there the process of experimenting began again. I used different apps and filters and effects and just tried out everything. I eventually got it down to the two that you see above.
