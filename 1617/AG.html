          Among the first of the works of this year was the Andy Goldsworthy inspired pieces. Andy Goldsworthy is an artist that is very inspired by and uses nature in his pieces. 
          For the piece we were asked to create some art to represent a few of the principles of design. This art was supposed to be based off work of Andy Goldsworthy. For this 
          piece I started exploring the idea. How would I get what I want out of the work. So I set to imagining. I searched online and found various works of Goldsworthy. I'd 
          compare and sort of figure out which ones I liked the most and what I could do with them. This was all preliminary planning. After that, all the following steps were 
          easier (some took more time, but they were still easier). After the drawing of it, I quickly accessed my work and did any changes that were needed.
