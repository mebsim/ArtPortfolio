          Lino block is an interesting method of creating art. We were given the instructions of creating and printing an image that connected with the theme of our "Vessels for Change". My topic/theme was entered around education. I did an immense amount of planning for this project. I thought through various options and landed on the idea of an owl. From there I also wanted a more hidden message. So while I was searching for an owl to base my prints off, I found out about the endangered owls. I looked through the owls trying to find one that was both very much endangered while also looked more like a stereotypical owl. I stumbled across mine, the Heteroglaux Blewitti (the Forest Owlet) which is critically endangered. From there I did various sketches in order to figure out how much detail I wanted. After that, I made a properly scaled drawing of it. Then I transferred that onto the Lino block, and carved it out. All I had left to do was make the prints. I had to come back on cut more out, due to my first prints having a lack of lines on them. I decided upon the one color, since my favourite color is orange, but also since I wanted it to balance out the darkness associated with owls.
