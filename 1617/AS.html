			I thought it was an interesting event. There was a variety of people coming from different backgrounds. They seemed to each gravitate to sections that they found most interesting.  liked the variety that was shown there. As mentioned there were things for everyone.

			Things that allowed people to show their creativity:
		</p>
        <ul class = "exampleText">
  			<li>VR</li>
  			<li>iPads</li>
  			<li>Traditional Art Gallery</li>
  			<li>Photography</li>
  			<li>Face Painting</li>
  			<li>Button Making</li>
  			<li>And more</li>
		</ul>  
		<p class="exampleText">
			Most people participated due to the variety of activities that we had running. This allowed most people to interact with the art. As mentioned before, different sections had different groups of interest. I think we have just found a good balance. Too many would have people rushing.

		  Above there is a photo of me looking at and explaining a piece that was at the show.

		  I, myself, contributed by doing various things during the Art Show. I did half a shift upstairs in the VR room, before I headed down and spent the rist of the shift at the Sphero Ball Area. I also did the a full shift at the iPad area. I helped create some signs prior to the show, which took me about an hour to create.
		  <br />
		  <br />
		  I think that the art show had a variety of things that were liked by the community and a lot of activities that allowed the community to express themselves in ways that the they would be unable to on a day to day basis and how the show depends on how the time goes. I hope that the art show will keep up to date with modern situations. What they can they expect is a collection of art that is done by students along with student run activities that allow the audience to participate.
		  <br />
		  <br />
		  The art show allows the community to express themselves in creative ways. It also gives them an opportunity to come together as a community and talk to each other.
