          During the year, a group brought in various lizards all in one day. We were to observe and sketch the lizards as part of an exercise. I tried to work in a bit of a cycle. I'd go to each station and sit down and sketch what I saw. Then I'd look at it and try to see what I've missed. I'd add some shading and add details to make it more recognizable.
