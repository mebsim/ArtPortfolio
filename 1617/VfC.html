          In the later half of the year, we were asked to create a "Vessel for Change" This vessel was supposed to present and represent an issue that is going on in the modern day. I had originally decided upon education, and the fact that many people do not have either proper education or any education. We were then to make a sculpture out of clay. I was originally planning that I would make a book stand with symbols on either ends that represent education. But once I started modelling, I was helping out some other people make theirs, when I decided to assemble our three models together and create a final idea. Our topic became centred around global warming, but we still kept our separate concerns. My section of the work, a pedestal that is not shown in the photo above, elevates and brings further attention to the issues presented by my partners. This piece does use and did use various elements and principles of design. One that was a major part of it was the element of size. The difference in size between the Earth and the fire that surrounds it brings more attention to the fire. This aids in making it obvious that the fire is the primary concern, and that it has grown to an excessively large size. Due to the nature of how we had assembled it, the proximity between the Earth and the flames shows a direct correlation and threat that it poses. This went on display in the Art Show and we had Nizar record a video to explain it. We also learnt about product photography (looking above at photo). We use this newfound knowledge as a part of this project.
