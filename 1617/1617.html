          Andy Goldsworthy Inspired Work

        Among the first of the works of this year was the Andy Goldsworthy inspired pieces. Andy Goldsworthy is an artist that is very inspired by and uses nature 
         in his pieces. For the piece we were asked to create some art to represent a few of the principles of design. This art was supposed to be based off work 
        of Andy Goldsworthy. For this piece I started...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="AG.html">Read More</a>

          Lino block is an interesting method of creating art. We were given the instructions of creating and printing an image that connected with the theme of our 
          "Vessels for Change". My topic/theme was entered around education. I did an immense amount of planning for this project. I thought through various options 
          and landed on the idea of an owl. From there I also wanted a more hidden message. So while ...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="LB.html">Read More</a>

          During the year, we were tasked with taking and editing images that we took. We explored and experimented with various angles, aperture settings and focuses. 
          After spending weeks on the photos, I eventually got it down to the photos I liked the most. From there the process of experimenting began again. I used 
          different apps and filters and effects and just tried out everything. I eventually got it down to...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="P.html">Read More</a>

          This year, we were required to create some signs. I tried to link the concept to my style of work (black and white, simplistic and modern). I made some 
          earlier work and expanded and improved the ideas. I got feedback and improved the idea. From there...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="S.html">Read More</a>

          During the year, a group brought in various lizards all in one day. We were to observe and sketch the lizards as part of an exercise. I tried to work in a
           bit of a cycle. I'd go to each station and sit down and sketch what I saw. Then I'd look at it and try to see what I've missed. I'd add some shading and...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="LO.html">Read More</a>

          In the latter half of the year, we were asked to create a "Vessel for Change" This vessel was supposed to present and represent an issue that is going on 
          in the modern day. I had originally decided upon education, and the fact that many people do not have either proper education or any education. We were 
          then to make a sculpture out of clay. I was originally planning that...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="VfC.html">Read More</a>

          Trashtown was a creation that me, Nizar and Alec had created. These people were also my partners in the Vessels for Change. Here we were tasked with creating 
          an artwork using garbage only. We got a large board and started placing various items. As we searched for more items, we started imagining what they resembled 
          like if they were a part of a little farm. The car was a nice catch...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="TT.html">Read More</a>
