          This is a drawing that I made in class. This is a drawing that shows perspective. I made by taking a round object, and using my pencil to make two small circles that are touching each other.
          From there I hand-drew the curves and started drawing by looking at the area around me for insperation. I have gone through other more simpler perspective. I love
           perspective drawing because of the amount of details and amount of thinking that has to be used to make the drawings. I am very much used to make drawings similar to this style.
          The drawing itself is small, I feel like a great amount of detail is in it.
