          After looking back at my own work, I see a lot of things. Throughout it, you find many hand-drawn objects. Being drawn with a pencil allows me to repeat and finilize everything.
          Within these drawings, you find that a large number of them are about this place I have called home. From the Haida Manga, all the way to my new title page, you find the
          theme throughout my drawings. This I feel might say that I'm really loving my country, which I am.
          <br />

          I show this using just plain lines, which means it focuses a lot on the bare
          bones of the subject. This makes me have to think about what I'm drawing. The lines make spaces that are inbetween the lines seem filled even though they are blank. This did
          not change as I progressed. Mainly this happend because at a much younger age started drawing with a pencil, making lines and found that I liked it a lot more than pencil crayons,
          markers or paint.
          <br />
          <br />
          I mainly tried to really plan what I am going to do in advance of actually drawing. From there I made a quick sketch, laying down my plan on the final drawing. From there I add details,
          focusing on finishing the drawing. This really made the finish version really nice and polished. Also this allows me to really get the small details of the drawing. This taught me a lot
          of different things, from planning to getting things right.
          <br />
          <br />
          I really improved my skills have been improved through the course, mainly through development and figuring it out. Otherwise, many of skills I have used are from previous art classes or
          just from my own spare time. I will say that the amount of planning that I put into development is something I will keep with me for a long time. This really makes my art better, and more
          fufilling.
          <br />
          <br />
          I feel like I did everything how I would do it. Mainly because at the end I learned quite a lot. I wish I had more time to really finish everything, but the lack of time forced me to go
          down different routes than I usually would. For those coming into grade 9 art, I would say stay relaxed, but have a certain amount of seriousness for the subject. I feel like I really
          this year was one of the years I expanded more upon than other years. So this year was really nice.
