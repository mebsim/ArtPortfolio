          In march, we started doing mandalas. Mandalas are circles, with art within. Although they have different interiors, they all have the same basic meanings. They symbolize wholness, togetherness
          and unity. Before we started the mandalas, I was spending time drawing celtic knots. I feel that inspired the contected loop of the shape. I at first made multiple very quick shapes, having the idea of reconecting a line
          This developed into me creating a small sketch of which then became the final triangle. We also should have made a background with watercolors, but I found the simplistic background is better.
        <br />
          This shows more of my more common work, which would be simple, pencil-drawn, complex drawings. I feel like the final version, which I created on the computer, could have been better if I spent more time
          positioning the triangles, it would have created a better end result. Overall, the circle makes a loop, which never ends.
