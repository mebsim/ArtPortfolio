          Around our midyear examinations, we had a guest from an art museum. They came and presented to us this artist, who made a comic. This comic though was not in the traditional style.
          He did it in the style that references the style of his people. This means different style of eyes, noses, mouths and ears. The comic itself had a message. The artist also had another
          trick. If you rip out all the pages, you can make it form this image. In our class, we attempted to replicate it. So they gave us all a setion of the image, and told us to draw a story.
          For my story, I went back to when I was a child. Then, during the winter, I had my first encounter with the coldness of snow. I had dropped my glove, allowing snow to enter it. Without
          realizing it, I put my hand back inside. My hand frozen, I ran back to warmth of the house.

          I made it very simplistic, in terms of colors. I mainly had white, gray and green. This makes the coat's red pop out even more, compared to everything else. I personally think that the blue
           that is used to give the white snow some color, might have been to much. Also, although the story goes from left to right, it is not enough for the reader to follow the order of photos. I still
          like it, especially since I do not use paint often.
