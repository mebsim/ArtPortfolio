          When in class, we went through a section about portrait drawings. We started by drawing the other half of faces that we found. Once we completed that,
          we were asked to make an drawing like this. This is a drawing of a photo that I found online of Abraham Licoln. With the photo, you put it in a website which makes grids appear on
          the photo. The grids are there as references so that we know where we are in the drawing. Once we printed the photo (which I did not do), we made the same grid on a paper and started drawing.
          This is what I made.

          I kept the lines on the page to remind the person seeing of the method used, but also because I could not erase all of it if I tried. I personally do not like the right (his left) eye, because I feel
          like it looks wierd. The hair also looks different from one side to the other. Overall though, I feel like it came out very nicely.
