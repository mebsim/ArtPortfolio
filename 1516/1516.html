          Portrait Drawing
        </p>
        <p class="exampleText">
          When in class, we went through a section about portrait drawings. We started by drawing the other half of faces that we found. Once we completed that,
          we were asked to make an drawing like this. This is a drawing of a photo that I found online of Abraham Licoln. With the photo, you put it in a website
          which makes grids appear on the photo. The grids are there as references...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="AL.html">Read More</a>

          Around our midyear examinations, we had a guest from an art museum. They came and presented to us this artist, who made a comic. This comic though was not
          in the traditional style. He did it in the style that references the style of his people. This means different style of eyes, noses, mouths and ears. The
          comic itself had a message. The artist also had another trick. If you...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="HM.html">Read More</a>

          Early on in the school year, we were asked to make a 3D model in an app. I made several models, including a bee and shark. The final one I chose, was a Spongebob
          that had a massive nose. We then had to draw it on paper. I started the first time, going quickly. We were ment to have the photo printed (I often do not print
          them out), but I just did it off a photo on the computer. I then started...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="BN.html">Read More</a>

          This is a drawing that is my own hand. From there I drew lines that correspond with the lines in my own hand. I then decided to use a variety of different line techniques
          to fill in the blanks that are there. From there I took it and started using a pen to outline the lines that I made with a pencil. For the larger and thick lines and
          squares I used a permenent maker. I then...<a style="font-size:12pt" href="Z.html">Read More</a>

          In march, we started doing mandalas. Mandalas are circles, with art within. Although they have different interiors, they all have the same basic meanings. They symbolize wholness,
          togetherness and unity. Before we started the mandalas, I was spending time drawing celtic knots. I feel that inspired the contected loop of the shape. I at first made multiple

        <p class="exampleText">
          This is a drawing that I made in class. This is a drawing that shows perspective. I made by taking a round object, and using my pencil to make two small circles that are touching
          each other. From there I hand-drew the curves and started drawing by looking at the area around me for insperation. I have gone through other more simpler perspective. I love

           Hello there. I am a grade art student. I mainly work with pencil (the HB variety) and more or less hate painting. I love intricate, detailed art rather than 'What does this make you feel' art.
           That probably appears in my art. I also love a challenge (as long as that challenge can be done with a pencil). I am not half bad with a camera, although when I do, I rather take photos of landsapes
           than people. I took art this year, because personnaly like art. The ability to see something and draw it seemed really cool. And then you can take an object and then change it, tweak it, making it look
           better and cleaner. From there you take a step back, and although you a critizing yourself, you block that part out and just admire your art. <a style="font-size:12pt" href="R.html">A more indepth reflection<a>
