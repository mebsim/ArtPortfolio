          This is a drawing that is my own hand. From there I drew lines that correspond with the lines in my own hand. I then decided to use a variety of different line techniques to fill
          in the blanks that are there. From there I took it and started using a pen to outline the lines that I made with a pencil. For the larger and thick lines and squares I used a
          permenent maker. I then took a photo (that looks terrible). I like making the different types of lines, especially the one that is in a sort of weave of over and under. I really
          made me think about how to use the lines and space that I have. I did not like smaller areas, where I was forced to make uneven lines that are not lined up well.
