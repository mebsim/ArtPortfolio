          Early on in the school year, we were asked to make a 3D model in an app. I made several models, including a bee and shark. The final one I chose, was a Spongebob that had a massive nose. We
          then had to draw it on paper. I started the first time, going quickly. We were ment to have the photo printed (I often do not print them out), but I just did it off a photo on the computer.
           I then started drawing. I did this in quick fast lines, which I then go over. Once I got to the end of the first time, I decided it was not completed, so I went over making quick notes, for
          things I should edit. Although I did not make shadows, I made marks for difference in shadow. I then did it all again. This time I used the same starting method, but I also did shadows. Like
          the first time, I decided to go over it and edit it. I made multiple edits, possibly even more than the first time. I could have continued to the third drawing, trying to make it proper, but I
          felt like the drawing, with the edits, were art themselves.
        <br />
          I made this drawing differently than most of my other art, this one is a left after I put comments. Usually when I do art, I erase when I edit, leaving only one copy. Here I decided that I
          should leave the problems, because it adds its own value and art. I personnaly have nothing wrong with the art, other than the fact that even after my first edit, I still found equal or possibly
          more edits.
